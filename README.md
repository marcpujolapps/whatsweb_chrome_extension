Have you ever tried to start a conversation with someone you've never talked before in Whatsapp Web? It's impossible.
You need to use your phone to add the person to your contacts app and you have to  start the conversation from there.

Using this Chrome Extension, you don't need to do all this. Simply fill the form with phone number and message and start messaging.

> Be careful, you need to refresh the page once the message is sent to see it through the Whatsapp Web UI
